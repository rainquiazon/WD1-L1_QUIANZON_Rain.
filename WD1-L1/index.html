    <p>
        The rain fell slow on the <i>empty road</i>.<br>
        <b><font color="pink">Yamada</font></b> walked alone, his <u>jacket</u> heavy with water.<br>
        He did not mind.<br>
        Silence was his friend tonight.<br>
        But at least the <u>moon</u> is bright.
    </p>

    <p>
        He saw a small <u>cat</u> under a <u>bench</u>.<br>
        Its <u>fur</u> was wet, its eyes wide.<br>
        <b><font color="pink">Yamada</font></b> stopped and knelt.<br>
        He offered his <u>hand</u>.<br>
        The <u>cat</u> stayed, watching.
    </p>

    <p>
        Trust takes time.<br>
        He sat beside it, the rain kept falling.<br>
        He shared his <u>bread</u>.<br>
        The <u>cat</u> ate.<br>
        In that quiet <i>street</i>, two lonely lives found warmth. 
        This proved that warmth does not only come from a fire.
